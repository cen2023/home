Ruth Keogh is a Professor of Biostatistics and Epidemiology in the Medical Statistics Department at London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine. Her research focuses on statistical methods for the analysis of observational data, and she works especially on causal inference methodology and methods for the analysis of time-to-event data. She is particularly interested in addressing practical challenges arising in real applications and is involved in a number of areas of application in health research, with a particular focus on cystic fibrosis. Other areas of interest include methods for handling measurement error and missing data, prediction modelling, and design and analysis of case-control studies. Ruth is funded by a UK Research and Innovation Future Leaders Fellowship.
