The conference venue at Biozentrum offers a breastfeeding room (exact location to follow) that can be used by participants during the conference. 

There is no childcare facilities on site, however, there are external providers in Basel that can be contacted:

* [kindernaescht.ch](http://kindernaescht.ch/) at Marktplatz (15 minutes from the conference venue at Biozentrum by foot) can host kids from 18 months to 12 years on an hourly to daily basis by prior arrangement.
* Contact Ms Spr√ºngli from [familea](https://www.familea.ch) at +41 61 260 82 82, who may be able to help with finding additional childcare options.
