<div id="about-basel" class="section level1" style="display:none">
<h1>About Basel</h1>
</div>
<p>Basel – Switzerland’s Capital for Art and Culture</p>
<p>Nestled in the heart of Europe, on both banks of the Rhine,Basel is a
pocket-sized metropolis that combines proverbial Swiss quality with a
multicultural population.</p>
<p>The city is the centre of the idyllic tri-border region of
Switzerland, Germany and France – lying between the Swiss Jura,
Germany’s Black Forest and the Vosges in Alsace. The narrow alleyways
and hidden squares with over 200 fountains as well as the many
century-old buildings and eye-catching sights such as the remarkable and
richly ornamented Town Hall or the Cathedral, that has stood gracefully
above the city for over 1000 years, combine to make Basel’s Old Town one
of the most beautiful and intact of its kind in Europe. In hardly any
other cityscape in Europe do historic buildings from the 14th and 15th
century blend so harmoniously with contemporary buildings.</p>
<p>It was not without reason that Basel is seen as Switzerland’s capital
of architecture. Just a few steps away from the picturesque Old Town you
will glimpse architectural masterpieces designed by internationally
renowned figures such as Richard Meier, Frank Gehry and Mario Botta or
the Basel-based Herzog &amp; de Meuron. Numerous winners of the
prestigious Pritzker Architecture Prize have immortalized themselves in
Basel with their buildings – a concentration of superior architecture
that is unique in the world. Buildings such as the Roche Towers,
Novartis Pavillon, Basel Exhibition Centre, Fondation Beyeler or Museum
Tinguely are the modern landmarks.</p>
<p>In Basel, art can be seen wherever you go, whether strolling through
the Old Town or when visiting one of the almost 40 museums. With their
themed collections, the museums have something for every taste, and many
have reputations that stretch far beyond the Swiss border. Kunstmuseum
Basel, whose history dates back to 1661, is one of the world’s very
first museums. Its collection includes many major works of art from the
last 700 years. Wandering through the halls, you will discover a
veritable “Who’s Who” of classical modernism, from Pablo Picasso to
Henri Matisse and Joan Miró to Paul Klee. Small wonder then, that
London’s The Times named the museum the fifth best in the world in
2013.</p>
<p>Walking around Basel and letting your eyes wander to the right and
left (and sometimes upwards) from time to time, you will be rewarded:
you will discover impressive street art and graffiti everywhere in the
city centre. National and international artists are also constantly
creating new, colourful artworks on the outskirts of the city. Urban art
has become an integral part of the art scene in recent years and is now
an indispensable element of urban tourism in Basel: <a

<div id="top-places-of-interest-in-basel" class="section level1">
<h1>Top places of interest in Basel</h1>
<p>These are the landmarks you should definitely not miss on your tour
of Basel:</p>
<div id="basler-münster-cathedrale" class="section level2">
<h2><a
href="https://www.basel.com/en/attractions/basler-muenster-bc9d869a33">Basler
Münster (Cathedrale)</a></h2>
<p>With its red sandstone walls, colourful roof tiles and twin towers,
no other building adorns the cityscape of Basel like the Cathedral. The
former episcopal church, built between the years 1019 and 1500 in the
Romantic and Gothic styles, is probably the most famous landmark in
Basel. The crypt, the chancel, the tomb of Erasmus of Rotterdam, the
Gallus gate and the two cloisters are witness to a fascinating tale of
construction over a period of several centuries. The piazza in which the
Cathedral stands is today a popular meeting place and is often used for
concerts and events. The Pfalz - the terrace offering wonderful views
over the Rhine - is one of the most popular viewpoints in the city.</p>
</div>
<div id="pfalz" class="section level2">
<h2><a
href="https://www.basel.com/en/attractions/pfalz-70feca698b">Pfalz</a></h2>
<p>The Pfalz viewing terrace in Basel offers fantastic views over the
Old Town and as far as the border triangle. The word “Pfalz” is derived
from the Latin word “Palatium”, meaning “palace”. The terrace high above
the Rhine and behind the Münster Cathedral is so-called because it is
situated close to the location in which the former palace of the Bishop
once stood. On one side of the viewing terrace are steps that lead down
to the landing jetty of the Münster ferry. On the other side there is a
small gateway leading to the quiet cloisters of the Cathedral. Here you
will find richly decorated gravestones of members of prominent Basel
families from the 16th to 19th centuries.</p>
</div>
<div id="city-hall" class="section level2">
<h2><a
href="https://www.basel.com/en/attractions/city-hall-7099cbb9f4">City
Hall</a></h2>
<p>The City Hall is the seat of the Basel government and its parliament.
In the midst of the Old Town, it is particularly eye¬catching with its
red facade, the characteristic tower and playful frescoes. It was built
after the great earthquake to replace the former seat of government.
After Basel joined the Swiss Confederation, the front part of the
building was replaced with an imposing new structure. The coats of arms
of Basel and the 11 other members of the then Confederation adorn the
crenellations. At the beginning of the 17th century, the city hall was
extended, and the artist Hans Bock decorated the facade with painted
trompe l’oeil. In 1900 the building was extended again to include the
left-hand wing and the tower at the right.</p>
</div>
<div id="spalentor" class="section level2">
<h2><a
href="https://www.basel.com/en/attractions/spalentor-a90d70d429">Spalentor</a></h2>
<p>The Spalentor (Gate of Spalen) is the most magnificent and impressive
of the three city gates still remaining from the city fortifications
dating from 1400. In times gone by, many important supplies and
provisions entered the city through this gate having arrived from
Alsace. Its square main tower, flanked on each side by two round towers,
would have been seen long before arriving at the gates of the city. The
façade facing away from the city is also decorated with three figures
dating back to the 15th century - the Madonna and two prophets.</p>
</div>
<div id="tinguely-fountain" class="section level2">
<h2><a
href="https://www.basel.com/en/attractions/tinguely-fountain-6259537a82">Tinguely
Fountain</a></h2>
<p>In 1977 Jean Tinguely created sculptural machines in a shallow
fountain where the stage of the old city theatre company once stood, and
in the process gifted Basel a famous modern landmark. The Swiss artist
lined a shallow fountain with black asphalt and created inside
mechanical figures powered by low-voltage current who appear to be
playing in the water. These ten iron figures are in constant motion and
conversation with each other - like the mime artists, actors and dancers
that once occupied the stage that stood in this spot.</p>
</div>
<div id="mittlere-brücke" class="section level2">
<h2><a
href="https://www.basel.com/en/attractions/mittlere-bruecke-b37cf289fc">Mittlere
Brücke</a></h2>
<p>Hardly another monument in the city of Basel has become such a symbol
of the city as the Mittlere Brücke. Opened in 1226, it is one of the
oldest Rhine crossings between Lake Constance and the North Sea. The
Mittlere Brücke was initially used for local traffic, in conjunction
with the development of the route over the Gotthard Pass as an
international trade route, in the 14th century it gained significance as
a crossing over the Rhine for international trade. With the advent of
electric trams, the old bridge had to make way for the new Mittlere
Brücke in 1905. A copy of the old bridge chapel, the so-called
“Käppelijoch”, where in the Middle Ages convicted criminals were
sentenced to death, was erected as a reminder of the original
construction.</p>
</div>
<div id="basel-zoo" class="section level2">
<h2><a
href="https://www.basel.com/en/attractions/basel-zoo-fd95eb5a48">Basel
Zoo</a></h2>
<p>The Zoological Gardens, known affectionately as “Zolli” by Basel’s
inhabitants, opened in Basel in 1874 and is home to a large number of
indigenous and exotic animals. The zoo is a popular excursion
destination and well worth a visit at any time of year. In the summer
months the park is an ideal place to stroll in the open air, in the
winter months the various animal houses guarantee up close and personal
encounters with a wide variety of animals. If you wish to discover an
underwater world, there are several underwater creatures to discover at
the vivarium.</p>

attached to a long wire cable and are driven purely by the current of
the Rhine itself. The ferries will silently bring you to the opposite
shore all year round. Experience the way in which time seems to stand
still during this brief crossing.<br />

works make him one of the most eminent pioneers in the post-1950 art
world. The permanent exhibition showcases a compilation of his work
spanning four decades – from early, filigree reliefs to the monumental
machine sculptures of the 1980s. Inspired by Tinguely’s ideas, Museum
Tinguely stages a wide range of events and exhibitions that seek to
engage with other artists and art forms, while providing an interactive
museum experience that appeals to all the senses.</p>

<h2>Modern Architecture</h2>
<p>Basel is seen as Switzerland’s capital of architecture. The number of
buildings designed by world-famous architects in such close proximity is
unsurpassed, all in the midst of an architectural setting that has
evolved over centuries. The Swiss architectural scene has an appeal that
extends well beyond the country’s borders. Numerous Swiss architectural
firms have attracted attention all over the world in recent decades with
a series of outstanding creations. Many of the renowned firms hail from
Basel such as Christ &amp; Gantenbein, Diener &amp; Diener Architects
and Herzog &amp; de Meuron. They have all helped to lay the foundation
of a lively architectural scene in Basel. Just a few steps away from the
picturesque and well-preserved Old Town you will glimpse architectural
masterpieces designed by internationally renowned figures such as
Richard Meier, Frank Gehry and Mario Botta. Numerous winners of the
prestigious Pritzker Architecture Prize have immortalized themselves in
Basel with their buildings – a concentration of superior architecture
that is unique in the world.</p>
<div id="roche-towers" class="section level3">
<h3>Roche Towers</h3>
<p>The Roche Towers, designed by architects Herzog &amp; de Meuron, can
rightly be viewed as a modern landmark of Basel – but as the tallest
office buildings in Switzerland, they can be seen far outside the city
limits, too. These two skyscrapers are home to the offices of the Roche
pharmaceutical group. Building 1 was completed in 2015 and, at 178
metres, was the tallest office building in Switzerland until it was
overtaken by Building 2 in 2022. Building 2 is 205 metres tall and has a
total of 50 floors. It is one of the most sustainable, energy-efficient
office buildings in the world.</p>

<div id="goetheanum-dornach" class="section level3">
<h3>Goetheanum Dornach</h3>
<p>The Goetheanum is situated in Dornach, around 10 kilometres outside
the city centre. It serves as the head office and conference venue of
the General Anthroposophical Society and boasts a distinctive shape,
which has also inspired the architects of neighbouring buildings.
Following the destruction of the original Goetheanum building in an
arson attack in 1923, the current building was constructed between 1925
and 1928. Both were designed by the esoteric Rudolf Steiner, the founder
of anthroposophy. The monumental exposed-concrete building is
particularly striking, owing to the almost complete absence of right
angles.</p>

<div id="novartis-campus" class="section level3">
<h3>Novartis Campus</h3>
<p>With about 20 buildings designed by top international architects, the
Novartis Campus is a true Mecca of modern architecture. f you are
interested in top-class architecture, appreciate short distances and
also enjoy quiet moments in green surroundings, then the Novartis
Campus, open to the public on working days, is just the place for you.
The list of architects who have put their stamp on the Novartis Campus
reads like a who’s who of architecture: Diener &amp; Diener kicked
things off in 2005, followed by SANAA and Peter Märkli (both 2006),
Marco Serra (2007), Vittorio Magnago Lampugnani and Adolf Krischanitz
(both 2008), Frank O. Gehry, José Rafael Moneo Vallès and Fumihiko Maki
(all 2009), Tadao Ando, David Chipperfield and Yoshio Taniguchi (all
2010), Eduardo Souto de Moura and Álvaro Siza (both 2011), Rahul
Mehrotra (2013), Juan Navarro Baldeweg (2014) and Herzog &amp; de Meuron
(2015). For the time being, the final piece of Vittorio Magnago
Lampugnani’s master plan scheduled for completion by 2030 is the
Novartis Pavillon – conceived by Michele De Lucchi. If you’re coming to
see the Novartis Pavillon with its artistically luminous zero-energy
media facade, you’d best plan enough time to visit the “Wonders of
Medicine” exhibition, where four interactive areas (exploring life,
disease, the history of medicine and the future of healthcare) invite
you to delve into the secrets of the life sciences. The Novartis
Pavillon is located in one of the carefully designed green spaces
bearing the signatures of leading landscape-architecture luminaries,
such as Peter Walker, Günther Vogt and Guido Hager. A diverse collection
of artworks – including a sculpture by Richard Serra, art within
architecture by Jenny Holzer, a sound installation by Laurie Anderson
and a 60-metre-high mural by Claudia Comte – make your visit
complete.</p>

<h3>Basel Exhibition Centre / Messe Basel</h3>
<p>The new Messe Basel trade fair building is one of the city’s newer
landmarks. The central architectural urban feature of the hall complex,
developed by Herzog &amp; de Meuron, is the City Lounge. This covered,
public space not only marks the entrance to the exhibitions, but also
functions as a meeting place for locals and visitors. The architects
called the prominent hole in the middle the “Fenster zum Himmel”
(“window to heaven”).</p>
