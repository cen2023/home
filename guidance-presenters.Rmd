## At the conference

*	Speakers should arrive in the session room 10 minutes before the session is due to start. Please introduce yourself to the session Chairs. Be aware of the time for your presentation.
*	A technician will be present in each session room to assist speakers in accessing their respective presentations.
*	All presentations will be controlled by the respective presenter from the lectern.
*	A microphone will be used for all presentations.
